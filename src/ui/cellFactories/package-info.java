/**
 * Provides custom implementations of JavaFX TableCells for handling specific data types.
 * The classes in this package are designed to enhance the default JavaFX TableView behavior 
 * by creating custom cell editors, including those that handle special data types, 
 * such as Date.
 * 
 * In particular, the {@link ui.cellFactories.DatePickerTableCell} class is included 
 * for editing Date values within a TableView cell using a DatePicker control.
 * 
 * <p>The package is responsible for defining custom cell factories that can be used 
 * within TableViews in the UI, allowing for customized data display and editing 
 * behavior.</p>
